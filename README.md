# Sophia's personal workout clock

**Stair climbing**  
1. Timer and counter start at first spacebar keydown
// TODO: start a youtube workout channel as well

2. Each time reps hit 25, the quote will randomly change to a new one
4. When user hit 1000, congratulations modal will pop up showing ending time

### Alternative: user can press stop button to stop (eg: go running outside)

// TODO: add each day's result to local storage or somewhere so you can track your progress
